# BBGMRatingsFix
Fix ratings of all players in BBGM with a quick program.

Make sure you have your .json export in the same directory as **BBGMRatingsFix.py**, then run the python
script in  Command Prompt/Powershell/Terminal/Unix Shell/etc.

This program was written in and for Python 3.8.0.

Will probably make the code nicer with a dictionary... someday...
